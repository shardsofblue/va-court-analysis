Preliminary findings on exported and cleaned data indicate the following:
* 41 total crimes have a trial penalty
* Only eight met a threshold of at least 100 cases concluded by either trial or plea.
* The three crimes with the greatest penalty, more than one year, are:
  * UNLAWFUL USE OF TELEPHONES
  * OTHER ILLEGAL WEAPONS
  * CIGARETTE TAX
* The remaining five crimes are:
  * MISCELLANEOUS FALSE AND FRAUDULENT ACTS
  * BAIL
  * GENERAL PROVISIONS: WELFARE (SOCIAL SERVICES)
  * LICENSURE OF DRIVERS
  * CONSPIRACIES
  
This preliminary analysis has serious limitations and should not be used to draw conclusions. This analysis does not take into account: 
1. ...life sentences, because these are not coded into the field used to calculate the average sentence time.
2. ...sentences that have been suspended.
