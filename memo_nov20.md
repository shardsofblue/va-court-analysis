Defendants charged with capital murder are much more likely to have their charges amended if they take a plea deal than if they go to trial.

Fifty-two percent of capital murder defendants who took a plea deal had their charges amended to something less serious, compared to 28 percent of those who went to trial--a difference of 24 percent.




This analysis: 
* Looked only at defendants charged with capital murder between 2013-2017 who were found guilty of that or a related crime
* Considered all life sentences as 99 years
* Did not account for double life sentences
