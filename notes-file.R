#File to store To Do tasks and make notes between collaborators

#TO DO----
#Apply all duplicated functions across all elements using function (apply?)
#[DONE] Compute meaningful cross-tabulated percentages one-by-one
#[IN PROGRESS (see scraps file)] Write a universal function to do the above
#Compare time served with hearing plea
#Count the number of charges per person_id
#Discover the mean length of time of plea bargain vs. trial

#COMMENTS----
#The majority of the plea data (82%) is NA, making this dataset meaningless. But the functions we develop can be used to analyse other datasets.

#A higher percentage of Hispanic people plead guilty (43.45%) than any other race
#The race with the lowest percentage guilty plea (besides race=NA) was Black (32.63%)
